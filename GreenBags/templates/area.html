<h2>Reaching Your Goal</h2>
<p>There are two charts below. One shows you how long it will take for you to achieve a goal you've set. If the chart does not hit the X-axis,
  we recommend that you try reducing you're spending or reduce the amount per month you wish to save for you're goal. Otherwise,
  you may wish to take out a loan. The other chart shows how much

</p>
<br>
<p>
  Here are some things we have chosen which will cause most impact to reaching you're goal without affecting you too much.
